# Discord Chatbot with OpenAI

This is a Node.js application that uses the Discord.js library and the OpenAI API to create a chatbot that can answer user queries. The bot uses the GPT-3.5-Turbo model to generate responses to user messages based on a given context.
Installation

    Clone the repository
    Run npm install to install the necessary dependencies
    Create a .env file and add your Discord bot token and OpenAI API key in the following format:


```bash
DISCORD_TOKEN=<YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN>
OPENAI_TOKEN=<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>
```

    Run npm run start to start the bot

## Usage

To use this bot, simply add it to your Discord server and start messaging it. The bot listens for messages that start with the "!" character and responds to them with the appropriate response generated by the GPT-3.5-Turbo model.

The bot is designed to provide accurate and succinct responses to user queries based on the provided context. The bot can handle both direct messages and replies to previous messages, allowing for more complex conversational interactions.
